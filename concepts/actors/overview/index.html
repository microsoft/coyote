      <h2 id="programming-model-asynchronous-actors">Programming model: asynchronous actors</h2>
<p>The <em>asynchronous actors</em> programming model of Coyote is an actor-based programming model that
encourages a message passing (or event based) programming model where all asynchronous actions
happen by sending asynchronous events from one actor to another. This model is similar to how real
people interact asynchronously via email.</p>
<p>Each Coyote actor has an inbox for events, event handlers, as well as normal class fields and
methods. Actors run concurrently with respect to each other, but individually they handle their
input queue in a sequential way. When an event arrives, the actor dequeues that event from the
input queue and handles it by executing a sequence of operations. Each operation might update a
field, create a new actor, or send an event to another actor. In Coyote, creating actors and sending
events are both non-blocking operations. In the case of a send operation the message (or event) is
simply enqueued into the input queue of the target actor and, most importantly, it does not wait for
the message to be processed at the target before returning control to the sender.</p>
<p>The actor model also provides a specialized type of actor called a <a href="../state-machines/">StateMachine</a>.
State machines are actors that have explicitly declared states and state transitions. Every object
oriented class that has member variables is really also just a state machine where that state is
updated as methods are called, but sometimes this gets really complicated and hard to test. Formal
state machines help you model your states more explicitly and <a href="../../../get-started/using-coyote/">coyote
tester</a> can help you find bugs by exploring different state transitions
using information you provide declaring how various types of events causes those state transitions.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="../why-actors/">how are Coyote Actors different from existing Microsoft Actor frameworks?</a>.</p>
<h3 id="declaring-and-creating-actors">Declaring and creating actors</h3>
<p>An actor based program in Coyote is a normal .NET program that also uses the <code>Actor</code>, <code>StateMachine</code>
and <code>Event</code> base classes from the <code>Microsoft.Coyote.Actors</code> namespace, which is available in the
<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Coyote.Actors/">Microsoft.Coyote.Actors</a> NuGet package.
Actors can be declared in the following way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">using Microsoft.Coyote.Actors;

class Client : Actor { ... }

class Server : Actor { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>The above code declares two actors named <code>Client</code> and <code>Server</code>. Being a C# class you can also
declare fields, properties and methods.</p>
<p>An actor can create an instance of another actor and send Events using the following <code>Actor</code>
methods:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">  ActorId clientId = this.CreateActor(typeof(Client));
  this.SendEvent(this.ClientId, new PingEvent());
</code></pre>
<p>When an event is being sent, it is enqueued in the event queue of the target actor. The coyote
runtime will at some point dequeue the received event, and allow the target actor to handle it
asynchronously.</p>
<p>All actors in Coyote have an associated unique <code>ActorId</code> which identifies a specific instance of
that type. Note that Coyote never gives you the actual object reference for an actor instance. This
ensures your code does not get too tightly coupled.</p>
<p>By limiting yourself to the Coyote API&rsquo;s for interacting with an actor, you also get all the
benefits of <code>coyote test</code> in terms of understanding more deeply how to test all asynchronous
interactions and ensure your specifications are maintained correctly. There is a lot of literature
on actor models that explain in more depth the importance of this message passing programming model
which is especially popular in the world of distributed systems. Event based programming is also
popular in User Interface development and even shows up in low level embedded systems. It is a
powerful tool for solving the tangled web of complexity that happens with less disciplined
architectures.</p>
<h3 id="starting-a-coyote-actor-based-program">Starting a Coyote actor-based program</h3>
<p>To create the first instance of an <code>Actor</code> you need to initialize the Coyote actor runtime inside
your C# process (typically in the <code>Main</code> method). An example of this is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">using System;
using Microsoft.Coyote;
using Microsoft.Coyote.Actors;
using Microsoft.Coyote.SystematicTesting;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        IActorRuntime runtime = RuntimeFactory.Create();
        Execute(runtime);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }

    [Test]
    public static void Execute(IActorRuntime runtime)
    {
        ActorId serverId = runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Server));
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You must first import the Coyote actor runtime library (<code>Microsoft.Coyote.Actors.dll</code>), which you
can get from its <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Coyote.Actors/">NuGet package</a>, then
create a <code>runtime</code> instance (of type <code>IActorRuntime</code>) which you pass to a <code>[Test]</code> method.</p>
<p>The test method named <code>Execute</code> will be the entry point that is used during testing of your Coyote
program. In this case it simply invokes the <code>CreateActor</code> method of the <code>runtime</code> to instantiate the
first Coyote actor (of type <code>Server</code> in the above example).</p>
<p>The <code>CreateActor</code> method accepts as a parameter the type of the actor to be instantiated, and
returns the <code>ActorId</code> representing that actor instance and this bootstraps a series of asynchronous
events that handle initialization of that actor and any operations it performs during
initialization.</p>
<p>Because <code>CreateActor</code> is an asynchronous method, we call the <code>Console.ReadLine</code> method, which pauses
the main thread until some console input has been given, so that the host C# program does not exit
prematurely.</p>
<p>The <code>IActorRuntime</code> interface also provides the <code>SendEvent</code> method for sending events to a Coyote
actor. This method accepts as parameters an object of type <code>ActorId</code> and an event object. It also
has a couple more advanced parameters which you don&rsquo;t need to worry about right now.</p>
<p>An event can be created by sub-classing from <code>Microsoft.Coyote.Actors.Event</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class PingEvent : Event
{
    public readonly ActorId Caller;

    public PingEvent(ActorId caller)
    {
        this.Caller = caller;
    }
}

class PongEvent : Event { }
</code></pre>
<p>An event can contain members of any type (including scalar values or references to object) and when
an event is sent to a target actor there is no deep-copying of those members, for performance
reasons. The target actor will be able to see the Event object and cast it to a specific type to
extract the information it needs.</p>
<p>Now you can write a complete actor, declaring what type of events it can handle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">[OnEventDoAction(typeof(PingEvent), nameof(HandlePing))]
class Server : Actor
{
    public void HandlePing(Event e)
    {
        PingEvent ping = (PingEvent)e;
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Server handling ping&quot;);
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Server sending pong back to caller&quot;);
        this.SendEvent(ping.Caller, new PongEvent());
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>Server</code> is an <code>Actor</code> that can receive <code>PingEvent</code>.  The <code>PingEvent</code> contains the <code>ActorId</code> of
the caller and the <code>Server</code> uses that to send back a <code>PongEvent</code> in response.</p>
<p>An event handler controls how a machine <em>reacts</em> to a received event. It is clearly just a method so
you can do anything there, including creating one or more actor instances, sending one or more
events, updating some private state or invoking some 3rd party library.</p>
<p>To complete this Coyote program, you can provide the following implementation of the <code>Client</code> actor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">using System.Threading.Tasks;

class SetupEvent : Event
{
    public readonly ActorId ServerId;

    public SetupEvent(ActorId server)
    {
        this.ServerId = server;
    }
}

[OnEventDoAction(typeof(PongEvent), nameof(HandlePong))]
class Client : Actor
{
    public ActorId ServerId;

    protected override Task OnInitializeAsync(Event initialEvent)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} initializing&quot;, this.Id);
        this.ServerId = ((SetupEvent)initialEvent).ServerId;
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} sending ping event to server&quot;, this.Id);
        this.SendEvent(this.ServerId, new PingEvent(this.Id));
        return base.OnInitializeAsync(initialEvent);
    }

    void HandlePong()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} received pong event&quot;, this.Id);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>Client</code> is an <code>Actor</code> that sends <code>PingEvents</code> to a server.  This means the <code>Client</code> needs to
know the <code>ActorId</code> of the <code>Server</code>.  This can be done using an initialEvent passed to
<code>OnInitializeAsync</code>.  The <code>Client</code> then uses this <code>ActorId</code> to send a <code>PingEvent</code> to the <code>Server</code>.</p>
<p>When the <code>Server</code> responds with a <code>PongEvent</code> the <code>HandlePong</code> method is called because of the
<code>OnEventDoAction</code> declaration on the class.  Notice in this case the <code>HandlePong</code> event handler
takes no <code>Event</code> argument.  The <code>Event</code> argument is optional on Coyote event handlers.</p>
<p>Note that <code>HandlePong</code> could also be defined as an <code>async Task</code> method. Async handlers are allowed
so that you can call external async systems in your production code, but this has some restrictions.
You are not allowed to directly create parallel tasks inside an actor (e.g. by using <code>Task.Run</code>) as
that can introduce race conditions (if you need to parallelize a workload, you can simply create
more actors). Also, during testing, you should not use <code>Task.Delay</code> or <code>Task.Yield</code> in your event
handlers. It is ok to have truly async behavior in production, but at test time the <code>coyote test</code>
tool wants to know about, so that it can control, all async behavior of your actor. If it detects
some uncontrolled async behavior an error will be reported.</p>
<p>One last remaining bit of code is needed in your <code>Program</code> to complete this example, namely, you
need to create the <code>Client</code> actor in the <code>Execute</code> method, in fact, you can create as many <code>Client</code>
actors as you want to make this an interesting test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public static void Execute(IActorRuntime runtime)
{
    ActorId serverId = runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Server));
    runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Client), new SetupEvent(serverId));
    runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Client), new SetupEvent(serverId));
    runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Client), new SetupEvent(serverId));
}
</code></pre>
<p>The output of the program will be something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plain">Client(3) initializing
Client(3) sending ping event to server
Client(1) initializing
Client(2) initializing
Client(2) sending ping event to server
Client(1) sending ping event to server
Server handling ping from Client(1)
Server sending pong back to caller
Client(1) received pong event
Server handling ping from Client(3)
Server sending pong back to caller
Server handling ping from Client(2)
Server sending pong back to caller
Client(2) received pong event
Client(3) received pong event
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>CreateActor</code> and <code>SendEvent</code> methods are non-blocking so you can see those operations are
interleaved in the log output.  The Coyote runtime will take care of all the underlying concurrency
using the Task Parallel Library, which means that you do not need to explicitly create and manage
tasks. However, you must be careful not to share data between actors because accessing that shared
data from multiple actors at once could lead to race conditions.</p>
<p>You can reduce race conditions in your code if you use events to <em>transfer</em> data from one actor to
another. But since it is a reference model without deep copy semantics, you can actually share data
between actors if you really need to. See <a href="../sharing-objects/">sharing objects</a> for more information in
this advanced topic.</p>
<h3 id="assertions">Assertions</h3>
<p>Coyote also supports specifying invariants through assertions. You can do this by using the <code>Assert</code>
method, which accepts as input a predicate that must always hold in that specific program point,
e.g. <code>this.Assert(k == 0)</code>, which holds if the integer <code>k</code> equals to <code>0</code>. These <code>Assert</code> statement
are useful for local invariants, i.e., they are about the state of a single actor. For global
invariants it is recommended that you use <a href="../../specifications/">Monitors</a>.</p>
