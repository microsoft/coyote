# IActorRuntime interface

Interface that exposes runtime methods for creating and executing actors.

```csharp
public interface IActorRuntime : IDisposable
```

## Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [Logger](IActorRuntime/Logger) { get; } | Used to log messages. Use [`SetLogger`](IActorRuntime/SetLogger) to replace the logger with a custom one. |
| event [OnEventDropped](IActorRuntime/OnEventDropped) | Callback that is fired when an event is dropped. |
| event [OnFailure](IActorRuntime/OnFailure) | Callback that is fired when the runtime throws an exception which includes failed assertions. |
| [Assert](IActorRuntime/Assert)(…) | Checks if the assertion holds, and if not, throws an AssertionFailureException exception. (5 methods) |
| [CreateActor](IActorRuntime/CreateActor)(…) | Creates a new actor of the specified Type and with the specified optional [`Event`](../Microsoft.Coyote/EventType). This event can only be used to access its payload, and cannot be handled. (3 methods) |
| [CreateActorAndExecuteAsync](IActorRuntime/CreateActorAndExecuteAsync)(…) | Creates a new actor of the specified Type and with the specified optional [`Event`](../Microsoft.Coyote/EventType). This event can only be used to access its payload, and cannot be handled. The method returns only when the actor is initialized and the [`Event`](../Microsoft.Coyote/EventType) (if any) is handled. (3 methods) |
| [CreateActorId](IActorRuntime/CreateActorId)(…) | Creates a fresh actor id that has not yet been bound to any actor. |
| [CreateActorIdFromName](IActorRuntime/CreateActorIdFromName)(…) | Creates a actor id that is uniquely tied to the specified unique name. The returned actor id can either be a fresh id (not yet bound to any actor), or it can be bound to a previously created actor. In the second case, this actor id can be directly used to communicate with the corresponding actor. |
| [GetCurrentOperationGroupId](IActorRuntime/GetCurrentOperationGroupId)(…) | Returns the operation group id of the actor with the specified id. Returns Empty if the id is not set, or if the [`ActorId`](ActorIdType) is not associated with this runtime. During testing, the runtime asserts that the specified actor is currently executing. |
| [Monitor&lt;T&gt;](IActorRuntime/Monitor)(…) | Invokes the specified monitor with the specified [`Event`](../Microsoft.Coyote/EventType). |
| [Random](IActorRuntime/Random)() | Returns a nondeterministic boolean choice, that can be controlled during analysis or testing. |
| [Random](IActorRuntime/Random)(…) | Returns a nondeterministic boolean choice, that can be controlled during analysis or testing. The value is used to generate a number in the range [0..maxValue), where 0 triggers true. |
| [RandomInteger](IActorRuntime/RandomInteger)(…) | Returns a nondeterministic integer choice, that can be controlled during analysis or testing. The value is used to generate an integer in the range [0..maxValue). |
| [RegisterLog](IActorRuntime/RegisterLog)(…) | Use this method to register an [`IActorRuntimeLog`](IActorRuntimeLogType). |
| [RegisterMonitor&lt;T&gt;](IActorRuntime/RegisterMonitor)() | Registers a new specification monitor of the specified Type. |
| [RemoveLog](IActorRuntime/RemoveLog)(…) | Use this method to unregister a previously registered [`IActorRuntimeLog`](IActorRuntimeLogType). |
| [SendEvent](IActorRuntime/SendEvent)(…) | Sends an asynchronous [`Event`](../Microsoft.Coyote/EventType) to an actor. |
| [SendEventAndExecuteAsync](IActorRuntime/SendEventAndExecuteAsync)(…) | Sends an [`Event`](../Microsoft.Coyote/EventType) to an actor. Returns immediately if the target was already running. Otherwise blocks until the target handles the event and reaches quiescense. |
| [SetLogger](IActorRuntime/SetLogger)(…) | Use this method to override the default TextWriter for logging messages. |
| [Stop](IActorRuntime/Stop)() | Terminates the runtime and notifies each active actor to halt execution. |
