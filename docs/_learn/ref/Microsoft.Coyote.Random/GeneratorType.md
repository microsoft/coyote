# Generator class

Represents a pseudo-random value generator, which is an algorithm that produces a sequence of values that meet certain statistical requirements for randomness. During systematic testing, the generation of random values is controlled, which allows the runtime to explore combinations of choices to find bugs.

```csharp
public class Generator
```
