| [RaiseHaltEvent](StateMachine/RaiseHaltEvent.md)() | Raises a [`HaltEvent`](HaltEvent.md) to halt the actor at the end of the current action. |
| [RaisePopStateEvent](StateMachine/RaisePopStateEvent.md)() | Raise a special event that performs a pop state operation at the end of the current action. |
| [RaisePushStateEvent](StateMachine/RaisePushStateEvent.md)(…) | Raise a special event that performs a push state operation at the end of the current action. |
