# SchedulingPoint.Suppress method

Suppresses interleavings until [`Resume`](Resume.md) is invoked.

```csharp
public static void Suppress()
```

## Remarks

This method does not suppress interleavings that happen when an operation is waiting some other operation to complete, when an operation completes and the scheduler switches to a new operation, or interleavings from uncontrolled concurrency.
